### Due date
Wednesday, April 5, 2017, at 11:00pm ET  
Grade value: 5% of your final course grade  

*If you wish to submit the assignment before the due date and time, you can do that.*  
<br>

### Objective(s)  
Work with Location Services.  
Work with Mapping Services.  
Create an interactive iOS app.  
<br>

### Introduction to the problem that you will solve
We thought it would be a good idea to create a special-purpose app that enables the device user to quickly locate and map *points of interest* near to them.  

Yes, the Maps app can be used for this, but that app is  general-purpose and feature-rich. This app will be a good opportunity to learn how to customize location and mapping to meet a specific need. Location-aware apps are growing in importance in the mobile space, so this will be useful now and into the future.  
<br>

### Getting started  
A *new* project template has been created, and can be found in the [Project_Templates](https://github.com/dps923/winter2017/tree/master/notes/Project_Templates) folder.  

Download *OpenStreetMapModel*, and rename it to "MyMapping", using the project-rename procedure that you have used in the past. 
<br>

#### Verify that the app runs
First, run the app in the iOS Simulator, so that you know that it does successfully run. It will display a list of teacher names, because that's what the project template does, by default. We will replace that functionality with our own.

### Submitting your work
Follow these instructions to submit your work:  

1. Make sure your project works correctly  
2. Locate your project folder in Finder  
3. Right-click the folder, and choose **Compress "(project-name)"**, which creates a zip file (make sure the zip file is fairly small, around 1MB or less)  
4. Login to Blackboard/My.Seneca, and in this course's Assignments area, look for the upload link, and submit your work there
