### Objective(s)
Work with graphics and touch  
Copy/install app to an iOS device  
Use the device camera  
<br>

### Introduction to the problem that you will solve
We need an iOS app that enables you to take and display photos of your friends.  
<br>

### Specifications
Create a new iOS app, using the Single View Application template. The name of the app should be **FriendPix**. 

It should target the iPhone, and do not use source control (e.g. git).

( more to come - will be cleaned up after the Thursday class/session )  

Here's a draft of what we'll probably do...

Single view Application  
Will have a single button  
It will show the camera app (on a device) or the photo library (on the simulator)  
Taking (or selecting) a photo will resize it (maybe 150 wide) and place it on the view  
The user can then drag it to a new location on the view  
Can repeat, to take (or select) another photo and reposition it  

It is possible that you may have to support "delete"  
And/or maybe "save"  
Will want a screen capture of the working app with a number of photos
