<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tests:</span></p>

<p>We have planned ten (10) tests during the term.</p>

<p>The duration of each test will range from 10 to 20 minutes. Each test will be worth 5% of your final course grade. 
All tests will be hand-written, and are scheduled at the beginning of the class timeslot. 
The total value of all tests will be 50%.</p>

<p>If you miss a test, there is no opportunity to do a replacement test. 
However, absence due to illness or other reasons happen occasionally. 
As a result, you can miss up to two (2) tests, without suffering the loss of grades.</p>

<p>The effect of this policy will be extended to all students. 
At the end of the course, your two lowest test results (worth a maximum of 10%) will be discarded, 
leaving your best 8 results.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Assignments:</span></p>

<p>We have planned ten (10) assignments during the term.</p>

<p>Each assignment has a one-week lifetime. 
Most are independent of each other. 
If you do not submit an assignment by the due date, its grade is zero, 
and there is no opportunity to earn marks for a late submission.</p>

<p>Each assignment will be worth 5% of your final course grade. 
The total value of all assignments will be 50%. 
At the end of the course, the lowest assignment result will be discarded, 
leaving your best nine results.</p>
