### Feedback on your work on Assignment 1  
Here's some feedback.  
Generally, pretty well done.  
Pay attention to the appearance of your code. Be consistent with indents and newlines.  
To fix up some of the appearance problems in your code, Xcode has a nice "Re-Indent" command. Here's how to use it, any time:  
1. Select all or some of the code in the editor.  
2. If using the menu, choose Editor > Structure > Re-Indent.  
3. Alternatively (and preferred!), press Control+I.

### Introduce and begin work on Assignment 3  
Assignment 3 has been published to the usual location.  
We will discuss a new topic, Tab Bar Controller.  
Then, we'll begin work on Assignment 3.
