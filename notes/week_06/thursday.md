### Review of this week's topics  
Creating your first Core Data app can be a challenge, because there are several tasks to learn, and some framework and runtime topics to learn.  

The best advice that we can offer is to be careful, and patient. Where appropriate, follow the instructions exactly. We are hoping that you will be able to understand and gain knowledge as a result of coding the apps.  

When working on the next assignment - in which you will use Core Data - one tactic that has helped other students in the past is to create and use/code a second project, which can be used for testing your code. The idea is that you will be able to make incremental progress, without affecting your main assignment project. After testing and confirming an idea in your test project, you can reproduce it in your assignment project.

### Introduce and begin work on Assignment 5  
Assignment 5 has been published to the usual location.  

We will look at a sample app, and the app's workflow.  

Then, we'll begin work on Assignment 5.
